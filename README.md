# Economic Data Science Portfolio

> Bridging traditional economic theory with modern machine learning techniques

## 👋 About This Portfolio

Welcome! I'm an undergraduate student passionate about **Economic Data Science** – the intersection where rigorous economic theory meets cutting-edge analytical tools. This repository showcases my journey learning to combine **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**, applying a 'Concept Extension' methodology that takes foundational statistical concepts (like regression) and scales them up using Machine Learning algorithms (like Lasso, Random Forests, and Neural Networks).

I'm actively seeking opportunities in **Data Analysis**, **Economic Consulting**, and **Finance** where I can apply these skills to solve real-world problems.

## 📚 Course Philosophy

This portfolio follows a **Concept Extension** approach:
- **Foundation**: Start with core statistical and econometric principles
- **Extension**: Scale these concepts using modern ML frameworks
- **Application**: Apply both traditional and advanced methods to economic questions

The goal is to understand not just *how* algorithms work, but *when* and *why* to use them in economic contexts.
